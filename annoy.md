### **1. Check the Sender's Email Address (The "From" Field)**

*   **Mismatching Display Name and Email Address:** The display name might say "Apple Support," but the actual email address when you hover over it (or expand the "From" field) might be `apple.support.ru@gmail.com` or `noreply@applesecurity.co.uk`. Legitimate companies use their official domain.
*   **Suspicious Domains:** Look for unusual endings (`.biz`, `.info`, `.xyz`, foreign country codes like `.ru`, `.cn`) or subtle misspellings (`gooogle.com` instead of `google.com`, `amaz0n.com` instead of `amazon.com`).
*   **Generic or Personal Email Addresses:** A "bank" or "government agency" will never email you from a `gmail.com`, `outlook.com`, or other free email service.
*   **Sender Impersonating You:** Some scams involve the "From" address being your *own* email address, trying to convince you that your account is compromised.

### **2. Scrutinize the Email Content and Message**

*   **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation Errors:** This is one of the most common and easiest tells. Legitimate organizations have professional communications teams. Scammers often overlook these details.
*   **Generic Greetings:** "Dear Customer," "Dear Valued User," or no greeting at all, rather than your actual name. Companies you have an account with usually address you by name.
*   **Urgency, Threats, or Fear Tactics:**
    *   "Your account will be suspended/closed immediately!"
    *   "Immediate action required!"
    *   "You owe money! Click here to pay now to avoid legal action!"
    *   "Your package delivery has failed, click to reschedule."
    *   "There's suspicious activity on your account." (While legitimate companies might notify you, they won't ask you to click a link to "verify").
*   **Requests for Sensitive Information:** **Legitimate companies will NEVER ask you to provide your password, Social Security Number (SSN), bank account number, credit card details, or PIN via email.** If they need you to update details, they'll direct you to log in *securely on their official website*.
*   **Too Good to Be True Offers:** Lottery winnings you didn't enter, inheritances from unknown relatives, unbelievably high-paying job offers, free iPhones, etc. If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is.
*   **Unusual Requests:** Asking you to send money via wire transfer, gift cards, or cryptocurrency. This is a massive red flag.
*   **Inconsistent Branding:** Low-resolution logos, outdated branding, weird fonts, or a layout that doesn't match the company's usual style.

### **3. Be Wary of Links and Attachments**

*   **Hover Before You Click (on Desktop):** Place your mouse cursor over any link without clicking. A small box will usually appear showing the *actual* URL the link points to. If it's different from what the text suggests (e.g., text says `amazon.com` but hover shows `malicious-site.xyz`), do NOT click.
*   **Long Press (on Mobile):** On a smartphone or tablet, press and hold the link. A pop-up menu will usually show the full URL.
*   **Mismatched URLs:** Be suspicious if the URL contains extra words, numbers, or a different domain (e.g., `amazon-verify.com` instead of `amazon.com`).
*   **Shortened URLs:** Services like Bitly (`bit.ly/xxxx`) or TinyURL (`tinyurl.com/xxxx`) hide the true destination. While legitimate at times, they are often used by scammers. Be extra cautious if an unexpected email contains one.
*   **Unexpected Attachments:** Do NOT open attachments (especially `.exe`, `.zip`, `.js`, `.vbs`, `.docm`, `.xlsm`) from unexpected or suspicious emails. These can contain malware or ransomware. Even PDFs or Word documents can carry threats.

### **4. Consider the Context and Unexpectedness**

*   **Did you expect this email?** Did you apply for something? Are you expecting a package or an invoice? If the email comes out of the blue, especially from an organization you don't usually interact with, be suspicious.
*   **Does it make sense?** If you don't have an account with a particular bank or service, why would they be emailing you about your "account"?
*   **Blind Carbon Copy (BCC):** If you see many recipients in the "To" or "CC" field (or if you're BCC'd on an email that should be personal), it might be a mass phishing attempt.

### **5. Psychological Tactics Used by Scammers**

Scammers play on human emotions:

*   **Fear:** Threatening legal action, account closure, or financial loss.
*   **Urgency:** "Act now!" "Limited time offer!" to make you panic and click without thinking.
*   **Greed:** Promising large sums of money or valuable prizes.
*   **Curiosity:** "See who viewed your profile," "You have a new message," etc.
*   **Authority:** Impersonating well-known companies, government agencies, or law enforcement.

### **What to Do if You Suspect a Scam Email:**

1.  **Do NOT Click Any Links:** Not even to unsubscribe (that confirms your email is active).
2.  **Do NOT Reply:** This tells the scammer your email is active.
3.  **Do NOT Download Any Attachments:** They are almost certainly malicious.
4.  **Verify Independently:** If you're unsure, *do not use any contact information from the email*. Instead, go to the official website of the company (type the URL directly into your browser or use a search engine) or call their official customer service number (from their website or a reliable source, not the email).
5.  **Mark as Spam/Junk:** This helps your email provider learn and block similar emails in the future.
6.  **Delete the Email:** Once you've marked it, delete it from your inbox.
7.  **Report It:**
    *   **Email Provider:** Many email services (Gmail, Outlook) have a "Report Phishing" or "Report Spam" option.
    *   **Impersonated Company:** If a specific company (e.g., Amazon, Apple, your bank) is being impersonated, forward the email to their dedicated fraud reporting address (you can usually find this on their official website).
    *   **Government Agencies:** In the US, you can report to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) at reportphishing@apwg.org or to the FTC.
